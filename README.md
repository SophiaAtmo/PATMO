# Welcome to PATMO

PATMO is a flexible code aimed at modelling 1D planetary atmospheres including (photo)chemistry, molecular/eddy diffusion, and multi-frequency radiative transfer.  
It is partially based on [KROME](http://www.kromepackage.org/), as it produces optimized problem-dependent Fortran code by using a Python pre-processor.
